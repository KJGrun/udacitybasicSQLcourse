Practicing LIMIT
Practice task: Try using LIMIT yourself below by writing a query that displays all the data in the occurred_at, account_id, and channel columns of the web_events table, and limits the output to only the first 15 rows.

Solution:

SELECT occurred_at, account_id, channel
FROM web_events
LIMIT 15

Practicing ORDER BY
Practice task: Write a query to return the 10 earliest orders in the orders table. Include the id, occurred_at, and total_amt_usd.

Solution:

SELECT id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY occurred_at
LIMIT 10

Practice task: Write a query to return the top 5 orders in terms of largest total_amt_usd. Include the id, account_id, and total_amt_usd.

Solution: 

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC
LIMIT 5

Practice task: Write a query to return the lowest 20 orders in terms of smallest total_amt_usd. Include the id, account_id, and total_amt_usd.

Solution:

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd
LIMIT 20

Practice task: Write a query that displays the order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for all the orders, sorted first by the account id (in ascending order) and then by the total dollar amount (in descending order)

Solution:

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY account_id, total_amt_usd DESC

Practice task: Now write a query that displays the order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for each order, but this time sorted first by the total dollar amount in descending order then the account id in ascending order

Solution:

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY  total_amt_usd DESC, account_id
